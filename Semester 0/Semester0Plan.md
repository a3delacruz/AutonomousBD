* Processes input and sends it to an `ai_queue` for further handling
* Serves as the foundation for integrating voice-based interaction

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Vosk** (speech recognition)
* **Ollama** *(planned for AI integration)*
* **NumPy** (numerical computing)
* **SoundDevice** (audio input/output)
* **Matplotlib / PyQtGraph** (data visualization)
* **VS Code**

# 📡 Project Overview: Real-Time Audio Spectrum Analyzer

## ⚙️ System Pipeline

```
Microphone → Buffer → FFT → Visualization (Loop)
```

This system continuously captures live audio, processes it using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and visualizes the frequency spectrum in real time.

---

## 🚀 Implementation Breakdown

### ✅ 1. Audio Capture

* Captured real-time audio from microphone
* Verified signal by printing raw data

### ✅ 2. Frequency Analysis (FFT)

* Applied Fast Fourier Transform
* Generated frequency-domain representation
* Plotted a single frame of the spectrum

### ✅ 3. Real-Time Processing

* Implemented continuous loop for live updates
* Enabled real-time visualization of incoming audio

### ✅ 4. Pitch Detection

* Identified dominant frequency in signal
* Displayed output:

  ```
  Pitch: XXX Hz
  ```

**Optional Enhancement:**

* Map detected frequencies to musical notes

---

## 🔄 Next Steps (In Progress / Planned)

### 🧠 Signal Intelligence

* Implement noise filtering:

  * Low-pass and band-pass filters
* Add peak detection for dominant signals
* Perform frequency band analysis:

  * Bass / Mid / Treble

> This phase transitions the system from **basic visualization → intelligent interpretation**

---

### 🖥️ User Interface (Planned)

* Start/Stop controls
* Adjustable parameters
* Clean, real-time display
* Optional audio feedback

---

## 🧠 Technical Notes

### NumPy

* Core library for numerical computing
* Enables efficient array and signal processing

**Installation:**

```bash
python -m pip install numpy
```

---

### SoundDevice

* Cross-platform audio library
* Captures and plays audio directly from NumPy arrays

---

### Matplotlib

* Used for plotting and visualizing frequency data
* Supports static and real-time graphing

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

* Built a full **real-time signal processing pipeline**
* Applied **FFT for frequency-domain analysis**
* Implemented **live audio visualization and pitch detection**
* Established foundation for **AI-integrated voice systems**

---

## 📌 Future Direction

This project will serve as the foundation for higher-level system integration, including:

* Voice-controlled robotics
